        <div> <h2> My Interests:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <b> Writing: </b> love writing stories and sometimes write my own stories. I like every type of writing. But I do kind of dislike writing balanced arguments as if I have found a lot of options for the FOR section, it is hard to find the same amount for the AGAINST section.</li> <br> 
            <li> <b> Sports: </b> I go to Badminton Club, Netball Club and Football club. I really hope to get on the teams. Other than these sports, I love Cricket, Tennis and Basketball. </li> <br> <br>
        </ol>
         </div>
         <div id="div2"> <h2> My Favourites: </h2>
